# GitHub Reporistory for "Neutron magnetic scattering backgrounds for low-threshold rare-event searches"

## Overview
This GitHub repository supports the paper "Neutron magnetic scattering backgrounds for low-threshold rare-event searches." The purpose of this research is to analyze low-energy background signals generated by atomic electron recoils caused by ambient neutrons in dark matter detector environments. While the magnetic scattering rate between ambient neutrons and atomic electrons is less than that of the elastic scattering rate between ambient neutrons and atomic nuclei at high energies, the opposite is true for lower energies at the 1-2 keV range. Therefore, for dark matter detector environments with high enough sensitivity, the neutron-election magnetic scattering background constitues a nonnegligible signal that must be accounted for in rare event searches.


## Numbered Directories
**0-Simulation-Inputs**: This directory contains all source term and geometry modeling inputs used to simulate neutron production and propagation through shielding materials, particularly relevant to underground labs such as SNOLAB. It includes two major subdirectories:

- SNOLAB Flux: Notebooks and data for modeling decay chains, shielding configurations, and source terms using tools such as `SOURCES-4A`. These simulations serve as the foundation for realistic neutron flux inputs, including outputs from decay chains and transport geometries.
- SOURCES: Contains source code, inputs, and output files for running the `SOURCES-4A` simulation package. It also includes configuration tapes and documentation for generating neutron spectra from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium chains within various materials.

These tools and data together form the foundation for flux modeling and serve as input for both neutron-nucleus and neutron-electron recoil calculations downstream.

**1-Neutron-Nucleus-Scattering**: This directory computes neutron-nucleus recoil energy spectra. This is a relatively well-understood and documented phenomenon but the inclusion of these calculations provides a strong baseline for comparison with neutron-electron scattering.

**2-Neutron-Electron Scattering**: This directory contains the full computational workflow for calculating recoil energy spectra from neutron–electron magnetic scattering, including differential cross-section evaluation, symbolic and numerical modeling, and energy scale comparisons. It builds upon foundational tools from `1-Neutron-Nucleus-Scattering` and includes exploratory notebooks that support validation and robustness checks of the electron recoil predictions, which are central to rare-event backgrounds in low-threshold detectors.

**3-Flux Modeling**: This directory focuses on modeling the energy distribution and transformation of neutron fluxes. It bridges raw source term outputs from `0-Simulation-Inputs` with physical predictions of how these neutrons interact and produce detectable signals:

- SCDMS_flux: Contains Jupyter notebooks and reference data used to construct, transform, and validate neutron flux models. This includes lab-to-center-of-mass transformations, energy spectrum visualization, symbolic calculations, and mass reference tables.

- saved_data: Stores precomputed neutron recoil spectra (`dRdEr`) in HDF5 format, which can be used for fast downstream analysis without re-running computationally expensive flux convolution calculations.

These flux modeling tools are central to predicting and comparing event rates from different neutron sources in various experimental environments.

**4-Comparisons**: This directory provides comparative analyses between neutron–electron magnetic scattering and other known backgrounds, such as neutron–nucleus scattering and beta decays. It contains overlay plots, rate comparisons, and trace analysis to contextualize the relative importance of each background in experimental settings. This marks the transition from theoretical modeling to data-driven interpretation.

**5-Final-Figures**: This directory contains finalized plots and figures to be used in the published paper and depict neutron flux characterization and event rate predictions and comparisons.


## Important Files

The `python` directory contains some sets of useful functions, many of which are self-explanatory.

* `neut-e-calc.nb` checks the cross-section calculations with a different method.


### Organization to do
* Rename notebooks so that there is a clear order
* Write instructions for running notebooks
* Create READMEs in each directory that lacks one
* Describe purpose of each notebook
* Highlight python functions
* Write an overview of the repository
* Sign thy name in the contributors list.

### Considerations
* Should we move all the data to one folder, instead of being split like this?
* Do figures and paper_figures need to stay split? (If yes, maybe the important figures can go top-level?)
* Have any notebooks become 'defunct'/do any no longer contain unique information that is relevant to the paper? (If yes we should move these, either to their own directory or to another branch or repository, or just delete them)
* Are any of the python libraries used in other repostiories of ours? (If yes we should make them packages to prevent de-syncing.)
* Can any of our directories become hidden or nested (e.g. mplstyles)?
* Are any files extraneous? (What is _MACOSX directory, that seems like it may be an accidental push)
* Is there some way we can automate testing to ensure that our reorganization doesn't break anything?
* Are the notebooks adequately documented/commented/annotated?

#### Specific Suggestions
(I can implement these if they're what we want to do, just don't know what's what here so didn't want to jump to conclusions)
* RGTC appears to be an external library of some kind. Remove the RGTC directories and zip. If they are needed, use whatever is the equivalent of a pip requirements file to make sure they get included.
* Move important figures to top-level numbered directories.
* lindhard.py and other copied libraries should be uploaded to pypi.
    * Maybe I should upload my mplstyles as well? they seem to be getting reused a lot. =^.^=
    * Should we make a fork of ENDF6 (was it modified) or can we simply create cloning instructions?
* Combine useful notebooks into a single directory numbered "0" and then number the notebooks.
* Combine all data into one directory, possibly with subdirectories for organization
* Remove the 'papers' directory, instead referencing the papers in this README.
