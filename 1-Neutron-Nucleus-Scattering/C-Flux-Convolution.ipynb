    "This notebook builds upon the preceding notebooks, `A-Differential-Neutron-Nucleus-XN.ipynb` and `B-Neutron-Nucleus-Recoil-Distributions.ipynb`. Our objective now is to calculate a realistic recoil energy spectrumâ€”that is, a prediction of how frequently we expect to see recoils at various energies when neutrons interact with a silicon detector. This calculation depends on two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutron Flux as a Function of Energy: The number of neutrons striking the detector material at each incident energy level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Cross Section for Neutron-Nucleus Scattering: The probability that a neutron of a given incident energy will cause a nucleus to recoil with a specific energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One specific recoil energy can be caused by many diferent incident neutron energies, depending on the two factors mentioned above. For example, a low-energy incident neutron colliding directly with a nucleus (small impact parameter) may yield the same recoil energy as a high-energy incident neutron colliding less directly with a nucleus (large impact parameter). We will therefore integrate over all incident neutron energies that can cause a given recoil energy. This will produce a calculation of how the energy distribution of the incident neutrons interacts with the detector's interaction probabilities, resulting in a measured recoil spectrum. This result is a flux-convolved recoil energy distribution, simulating what we would expect to measure in a detector."

    "Load Neutron Flux and Calculate Recoil Spectrum\n",

    "This section will allow us to determine the likelihood of a neutron with energy $E_n$ scattering off a nucleus and depositing a certain amount of recoil energy $E_r$. This likelihood is given by the differential cross section $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dE_r}(E_n,E_r)$. In the previous notebook, `B-Neutron-Nucleus-Recoil-Distributions.ipynb`, we developed code that calculates this value for specific energies. Now, we want to generalize it. The following section will provide us with the expected distribution of nuclear recoil energies measured by the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrons interact with detectors at differing initial energies ($E_n$), and the number of incident neutrons at a given specific energy is described by the neutron flux spectrum, $\\Phi(E_n)$. These neutrons recoil at varying energies ($E_r$) depending on factors including their incident energy and the collision's differential cross section $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dE_r}(E_n,E_r)$. The total rate at which these recoils happen is found by summing the contribution from all differentiaal neutron energies that could cause a recoil of that amount. In other words, we must sum over all neutron energies that can produce a specific recoil energy. Hence, we integrate. We will use the following equation to calculate the differential event rate per unit recoil energy:\n",
